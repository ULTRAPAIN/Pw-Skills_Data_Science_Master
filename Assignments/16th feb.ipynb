    "A database is a collection of data that is organized and stored in a structured manner to enable efficient access, retrieval, and manipulation of the data. Databases can be used for a variety of applications, such as storing customer data, tracking inventory, and managing financial transactions.\n",

    "SQL and NoSQL are two types of database management systems (DBMS) that differ in their approach to organizing and storing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data model: SQL databases use a relational data model, while NoSQL databases use a non-relational or distributed data model.\n",

    "Schema: SQL databases use predefined schemas, while NoSQL databases do not have predefined schemas.\n",

    "Scalability: SQL databases are vertically scalable, meaning they can handle larger amounts of data by adding more resources to a single server. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, meaning they can handle larger amounts of data by distributing data across multiple servers.\n",

    "Query language: SQL databases use SQL queries to manipulate and retrieve data, while NoSQL databases use different query languages and APIs.\n",
